            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:37730:3"/>for my ſelf and a poor oppreſſed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of profeſſed Chriſtians, who have choſen me to be their Miniſter, were hedged up. I do not preſume to come before you out of any abſurd truſt or vain confidence that I ſhall finde favour; neither can fear of diſpleaſing keep me off (for that in either I ſhould have diſhonourable thoughts of that dreadfull Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal; which all that are lovers of God, their Country, and true Religion, will make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of entertaining but in expectance and hope to finde Juſtice, as it is meet I and every one elſe ſhould at your hands; ſo it is (may it pleaſe your honours) that for preaching of theſe Sermons (which here I humbly preſent to your view) I was judged unworthy to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the employment of Goſpel-preaching by ſuch as are mine and the Truths, yea moſt of them the States enemies. And thereupon a great part of my livelyhood was (and is yet) detained, though ſetled in a regular way upon certain Truſtees to my uſe (as being the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full preaching Miniſter of <hi>Taviſtock</hi> in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>von</hi>) out of a Sheaf or Rectory neer adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; taken in <hi>15</hi> years value at <hi>90. l. per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num: 1350 l.</hi> being deducted in lieu of the ſaid Parſonage out of the fine which the Gentleman was ſet at in his Compoſition for Delinquency, who formerly was ſeized in Fee-ſimple therein.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:37730:3"/>
            <p>Whereupon receiving (as I apprehended it) a Call from God, to be employed in my Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction elſewhere, I obeyed it; and departed from the aforeſaid Town of <hi>Taviſtock,</hi> with a purpoſe to return thither no more to dwell among them.</p>
            <p>But receiving Letters from the godly party, from time to time, in which there ſeemed to be a ſtrong continued Call that I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn: I began to conſider what was beſt to be done, whether to prefer my profit and eaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuffering affliction with the People of God (as I had cauſe to fear I did) or to truſt God, of whoſe owning of me (with humility be it written) I had ſo many, ſo great experiences: And at laſt I reſolved to adviſe with Godly, learned and judicious Miniſters, which thing I alſo did, and found them all to agree (upon view of the Letters ſent me) that I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. One ſaid,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> H.P.</note> that I could not part with the Godly party at <hi>Taviſtock;</hi> and that he believed others would be of his minde when they did view the Call. Another,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> L.S.</note> that I would go off lame, and not recover while I did return. And ſo a third likewiſe; adding that my Caſe was his, and he muſt return to — whence for want of maintenance he had departed. Here God enabled me to deny my ſelf, and I
<pb facs="tcp:37730:4"/>wrote from <hi>London</hi> news of my reſolution to come among them.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> I.B.</note> But as ſoon as that news came to the ears of the adverſe party, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be imagined with what wrath of pride they run together. I will ſet down an extract of a Letter. — <hi>For ſince we heard that happy news of your comming, the Enemies do moſt furiouſly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>age, and have acted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether (as we hear) to ſend a Letter to the Earl of</hi> Bedford, <hi>that at no hand he ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now that I may ſum up all in a few lines; This is the caſe; I was choſen by the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Taviſtock</hi> (My Lord of <hi>Bedford</hi> having promiſed to preſent and pay him whom they would chuſe.) Their choice under many ſcore hands, accompanied with atteſtations of the neighbouring Miniſters, procured a legal preſentation to the incumbency, without my ſtirring at all in the buſineſs, (indeed (to ſay truth) I had not freedom of ſpirit to do) I continued Preaching Miniſter quietly ſome time, and might ſtill, had not my judgement concerning Diſcipline made me liable to diſlike and Obloquy.</p>
            <p>But now, they that were otherwiſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and profane ones, gnaſh their teeth to ſee Chriſts Ordinances on foot in publique, and
<pb facs="tcp:37730:4"/>themſelves laid by as Reprobate Silver; and begin to quarrel at my preaching, and to joyne ſhoulder to ſhoulder againſt the new Church (as they were pleaſed to call us that laboured to ſerve God in the ſpirit, according to his word) and would have another to be their Miniſter that would, (according to Cuſtome,) carry on (as they call it) Gods good ſervice; Hereupon the Raſcal Multitude are encouraged to abuſe the Godly Party. Such as were Officers, Troo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and Foot-Souldiers in the late Kings Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, are thought fitter to be choſen Officers for the Pariſh, then men that have lain in priſon or by the hedges in cold nights, and have been Plundered for their fidelity to the Parliament by their own wicked Neighbours; while the ringleader of this preſent adverſe Party was in the Kings Quarters in <hi>Cornwall;</hi> Who now ſtands up like a Champion, and with big words thinks to trample down Gods People whom he (in a Letter written to one of them) calld the Rigid Faction.</p>
            <p>I Humbly crave leave in the heat of a Chriſtian, and fidelity of a Commoner of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to write, and I will write no more then I can proove (for I know whom I appeal unto) that the differences at <hi>Taviſtock</hi> are no other but between Chriſt and <hi>Belial;</hi> The Common
<pb facs="tcp:37730:5"/>Wealth of <hi>England</hi> and Royalty; worſhipping of God according to rule, and Superſtitious cuſtomary formality, whatever men pretend to the contrary.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe theſe enſuing Sermons are ſo cried down for unſufferable railing with which they are ſtufft by report of the Enemy; I have faithfully tranſcribed them and (with the help of ſuch as wrote in ſhort hand) brought them to that paſs that now they appear in: Being verily perſwaded that not one harſh expreſſion (which might be more excepted againſt then another) is left out. Neither would I be thought to print them out of opinion that (in theſe glorious times of Gods giving gifts to men) they will give any great blaze; But to give an account of my manner of ſpeaking in the name of the Lord: That ſo, if it ſeem good unto you, I may be reſtored to my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and employment in the work of the Lord at <hi>Taviſtock</hi> (though I ſhall in regard of means of ſubſiſtence have much leſs then I am to have ſhould I continue Miniſter there, where I am come under the bond of Conſcience; and whither I am by jealous Letters, and by ſtrong Arguments woed to return again) Or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe may ſubmit to Gods will and pleaſure (in whoſe hands are the hearts of all, to turn them
<pb facs="tcp:37730:5"/>which way ſoever he pleaſeth; and therefore yours) with this comfortable teſtimony, in mine own Soul, that I am ready to do my duty, keep my ſtation, and go in and out before the People over whom the Lord hath made me Overſeer: So far and ſo long as it ſhall pleaſe his heavenly Majeſty to give me life, liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and liberty ſo to do. And if my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries have any thing to charge me with, that is of legal cogniſance; I ſtand at our <hi>Engliſh Caeſars</hi> judgement ſeat, where let me be judged in Gods name. I that have learnd by his Grace to look with boldneſs on my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Heaven, in Chriſt; need not fear thoſe (but rather flie to them,) that are his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for our good on Earth; beſides I am of them that have in moſt parts of <hi>England,</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the latter end of the former Chap. from the ver. 33. to the end thereof, Chriſt under a Parable of a certain houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, planting a Vineyard, and letting it out to Husband-men declares,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:37730:9"/>Firſt, Gods mercy towards the Jews, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them for his Church, <hi>ver.</hi> 33.34. of that Chapter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Their great ingratitude towards him, manifeſted by their cruell dealing with, and uſage of his Servants; beating ſome, and killing others: And by their moſt wicked murthering of his own Son: <hi>ver.</hi> 35. unto the 40.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Gods judgements to be inflicted on them for the ſame, and that by their own acknowledgement, <hi>ver.</hi> 40.41.</p>
               <p>Now in the former part of this 22. <hi>Chap.</hi> our Saviour mentioneth under another Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, Gods abundant kindneſs both towards the Jews, and alſo the Gentiles, in the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Means of Grace and Salvation. In which Parable, conſider, Firſt, the Preface, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, or Introduction unto the ſame: Secondly the Parable it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The Introduction is in the 1 <hi>verſe. And Jeſus anſwered and ſpake unto them again by Parables, ſaying.</hi> In which words we have, Firſt, the Party propounding the parable. <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Secondly, the occaſion intimated in the Word, <hi>Anſwered,</hi> to wit, one ſpeaking touching the bleſſed condition of ſuch as ſhall eat bread in the Kingdom of Heaven. <hi>Luke</hi> 14.15. Laſtly the Parties to whom this
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37730:9"/>Parable was propounded, <hi>viz.</hi> unto the Auditors preſent in the Phariſees houſe, as may be ſeen out of the forementioned <hi>Luke</hi> 14 <hi>ver.</hi> 7. of that <hi>chap</hi> But (to paſs over theſe things) come we to the Parable it ſelf; In which we have to conſider,</p>
               <p>Firſt, what is ſpoken of, or repreſented; to wit, the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereby it is repreſented, of which afterward.</p>
               <p>For the Subject matter, <hi>viz.</hi> The Kingdom of Heaven, we muſt enquire after the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the words in the firſt place. Know therefore, that ſometime theſe words, <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> ſignifie <hi>the Kingdom of Glory;</hi> but not ſo here. Sometimes they are taken for the Kingdom of Grace; and that in diverſe reſpects.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the manner of the working of Grace is ſometime meant; as <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.31.32. in the Parable of the grain of muſtardſeed and of the leaven.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In reſpect of the ſeaſon of grace, as <hi>Math</hi> 3.2. <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand;</hi> hat is, now is the ſeaſon of Grace, now the door of the Kingdom ſtandeth open.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in reſpect of the meanes of Grace, the Preaching of the Goſpel; So this Phraſe,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37730:10"/>the Kingdom of Heaven is uſed <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.47. where it is compared <hi>to a Nett that was caſt into the Sea, and gathered of every kind;</hi> The ſame phraſe is uſed alſo, Fourthly, for the viſible Church (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="5 letters">

                  </gap>ll theſe particulars, is this Phraſe uſed by the Holy Ghoſt. Grace in the heart is like a grain of Muſtard ſeed, which is the leaſt of all Seeds; Yet afterward it comes to be a great Tree; So that in thoſe Eaſtern places, the birds made Neſts in the Branches of them (as the Scripture ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.) And we have ſeen very great Stalkes with Branches in this our own Land in ſome places. The firſt ſeed of Grace, is very little, and ſometimes it is long before a gratious Soul can perceive any thing in himſelf, of this pretious ſeed, in his own Soul: But at laſt it makes ſign where it is. And for that other reſemblance, you know Leaven gives a tang to all the Meal; ſo doth Grace to the whole man. And for the opportunities of Grace, and the powerfull preaching of the Goſpel, they may well be called the Kingdom of Grace. They are the very way to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3. the knowledge of God and Chriſt is ſaid to be life eternal, becauſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37730:10"/>it is the way unto it. In the ſame regard <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.50. his Commandments are called life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting; to wit, becauſe the obſerving of them brings to life everlaſting, and they are ſure fruits of faith in Chriſt. So, I ſay the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, is called the Kingdom of Heaven, becauſe it is that by which God hath appointed to bring Souls unto the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
               <p>This being the acceptation of the Phraſe (as I take it) in this Parable, I will give you ſome reaſons why it may very fitly ſo be called.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in regard of God the Author, the King of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In regard of the end of the preaching of the Goſpel, <hi>viz.</hi> to prepare and fit people for Heaven, to ſhew them the way of Salvation. The Divel himſelf in the Pythonyſs acknowledgeth rhis truth. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.17.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In regard of the preſent condition of ſuch as receive the word. I believe it, they are heirs of the Kingdom, priviledged with a guard of Angels. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. Kings and Kingdoms, are terms of relation. All the Saints are made Kings as well as Prieſts. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6. The impoſition of this high tittle on Goſpel-preaching, gives occaſion to note
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37730:11"/>

                     </label> That the Preaching of the Goſpel, where it is afforded, is a very great and pretious vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafement.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The truth of this Point will the better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we take notice of the glorious titles given to the word preached in Scripture; It is called <hi>a hidden treaſure, Mat.</hi> 13.44. <hi>a Pearl verſes</hi> 45 46. <hi>The word of eternal life.</hi> Joh. 6.68. <hi>The words of this life,</hi> Acts 5.20. <hi>The word of Salvation.</hi> Acts 13.26 <hi>The Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of God,</hi> Act. 28.28. <hi>The power of God unto Salvation.</hi> Rom. 1.16. <hi>The word of faith.</hi> Rom 10.8 <hi>The word of reconciliation.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19. <hi>The grace of God that bringeth Salvation.</hi> Titu. 2 11. <hi>The immortal ſeed of regeneration.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.23.

                  </label> And that not without cauſe; for,</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, It hath a notable power, to illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the underſtandings of men. Therefore we find that <hi>the people which ſate in darkneſs</hi> (when Chriſt came among them to preach) <hi>ſaw a great light: And to them which ſate in the region and ſhadow of death light was ſprung up. Mat.</hi> 4.16. And that Chriſt (preached) is ſet to be <hi>a light of the Gentiles, and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37730:11"/>unto the ends of the earth,</hi> Act. 13.47.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, It is of great power to convince the conſcience: So we may ſee 1 Cor. 14.25.26. <hi>But if all Propheſie, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all. And thus are the ſecrets of his heart made manifeſt; and ſo falling down on his face, he will worſhip God, and report that God is in you of a truth.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith (ſpeaking of this word) 2 Cor. 10.4.5 6. <hi>For the weapons of our war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare are not carnal, but mighty through God, to the pulling down of ſtrong holds. Caſting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt. And having in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to revenge all diſobedience, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo Heb. 4.12. <hi>For the word of God is quick and powerfull, and ſharper then any two edged ſword, piercing even to the dividing aſunder of ſoul and ſpirit, and of the joynts and marrow, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</hi> This iron Mace knocks down the contradictory ſpirits of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, This word (called the Kingdom of heaven) works faith and ſound converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That muſt be of great worth, which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a man into Heaven, and giveth him
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37730:12"/>Power to prevail with God, and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the world, all which faith doth. But this the word preached doth work, as may be plainly ſeen, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>It is the power of God unto Salvation.</hi> Rom. 1.16. <hi>The engraffed word which is able to ſave our Soules.</hi> Jam. 1.12. <hi>That brings Salvation.</hi> Tit. 2.11. Highly eſteemed; bonds and loſs of life do not move <hi>Paul,</hi> if he may fulfill his miniſtery. <hi>Acts.</hi> 20. <hi>ver.</hi> 22. to the twenty fifth. The Saints weep and ſorrow for the loſs of <hi>Paul, ver.</hi> 37.38. And both for Preacher and People, Read Acts 21.13. <hi>Then Paul anſwered, What mean ye to weep and to break my heart? For I am ready, not only to be bound, but alſo to die at Jeruſalem for the name of the Lord Jeſus;</hi> You ſee then how <hi>Paul</hi> prizeth it, and how the Saints prize it, and weep to hear of the binding of that bleſſed Preacher <hi>Paul.</hi> Angels ſcorn not to learn of the Church the Myſteries of the Goſpel, <hi>Epheſ</hi> 3.10. they enquire after theſe things of the word, 1 Peter 1.12. <hi>which things the Angels deſire to look into.</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                  </label> Now for the uſe of the point. <hi>Seing Goſpel-preaching is ſuch a rich Vouchſafement: Surely then, great is their folly which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value the ſame.</hi> And of theſe there are two ſorts.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:37730:12"/>
               <p>Firſt, Prophane people, fooliſh Gaderens, that loſe the ſeaſons and opportunities in which God way be found; in which they might meet with this rich jewell Chriſt. Theſe were wont to be the only men we had to oppoſe.</p>
               <p>But now we have a Second ſort, Such as are deluded, and puzled by the Divel; It is ſad to conſider, that many (once) forward and eminent profeſſors of Religion, do now account it the height of their excellency to ſlight preaching and preachers. The ground of this extream, is the formalitie of the Calves-men in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> againſt whom zeal burning for lack of watchfulneſs and warineſs, and their unadviſedneſs of Sathans wiles, hath driven many into theſe extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies in theſe Ordinance-contemning dayes. We were wont to ſhoot our arrows againſt that ungodly generation, who by</p>
               <p>Firſt, Their careleſs comming.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Their unreverent behaviour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Looſe carriage afterwards: and loſing by and by what they have heard <hi>Luke</hi> 8.12. gave us greateſt offence.</p>
               <p>But now (alas) fear of being gull'd by black coats hath brought a ſnare upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; endangered by men whoſe coats are

               <p>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37730:21"/>Grace, ſhould not periſh, but have life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</hi> This Grace of God is by much the Elder brother, if we look no higher then <hi>Abraham.</hi> Gal. 3.17. And <hi>this I ſay,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) that the Law which was</hi> 430. <hi>years after, cannot diſannull the Covenant that was before of God in reſpect of Chriſt that it ſhould make the Promiſe of none effect.</hi> All is of Grace.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Election is of Grace Rom. 11.5. <hi>There is a remnant according to the election of Grace.</hi> Epheſ. 1.5, 6. <hi>Having predeſtinated us, &amp;c according to the good pleaſure of his will, to the praiſe of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.</hi> See <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. to the tenth. And in many other places.</p>
               <p>Secondly, all the Coordinated Mediums, all that God works by, all are free and of Grace.</p>
               <p>As firſt, Chriſt is given, Romans 8 32. <hi>Who ſpared not his own Son, but gave him for us all to Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The word bringing ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is free, and is therefore called the Grace of God. (Titus 2.11.) <hi>bringing Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Repentance is of Gods giving alſo. <hi>Acts</hi> 11.18.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:37730:21"/>
               <p>Fourthly, Likewiſe Faith, that mother-Grace, is the gift of God. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. And generally the whole Law of the Spirit of life, as it is called <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. is of Gods gracious working, as is teſtified Epheſ. 2.1. <hi>And you hath he quickned which were dead in treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and ſinnes.</hi>

God forbid; how ſhall we that are dead to ſin, live any longer therein? Know ye not that ſo many of us as were baptized into Jeſus Chriſt, were baptized into his death.</hi> And ſo for outward things, we are taught by Chriſts example in his Agony, to ſay, <hi>not my will, but thy will be done.</hi> In a word to take pleaſure in the lovely wayes of holineſs, and to referr our ſelves to Gods Love, Care, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,

But the main thing in hand is to ſtir you up, to keep begging of this Grace, that is of the diſcovery of Gods love to thy poor Soul, and that God would lift up upon thee the light of his Countenance. So much of the firſt particular.</p>
               <p>We come to the ſecond; to wit, to ſhew you what is meant by the Marriage of the Kings Son. Even no other thing, no leſs priviledge, then a moſt neer Union between Chriſt and the Elect. For even as a man and a woman by the bond of Marriage become one, Gen. 2.24. <hi>Therefore ſhall a man leave his Father, and his Mother, and ſhall cleave unto his Wife: and they twain ſhall be one fleſh;</hi> and ſo <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.4, 5, 6. it is confirmed by Chriſt, and ſaid to be a Union and a joyning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by God: So is it between Chriſt and his Church. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 23. and 31.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:37730:24"/>and Paſſion, and glorious Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion ſhould be offered to all the world of the Jews and Gentiles; and that there ſhould be a General invitation to the end, that as many as come, ſhould be not only Gueſts, but the very Spouſe, and be married to Chriſt, and aſſured thereof by the ſpirit of faith and ſanctification. So That the Doctrine ſhall be,</p>

                  <hi>That there is a Marriage made, and agreed upon, for the Son of God by God the King of Kings with every gracious Soul.</hi> Tis ended (as we uſe to ſay) between them. This is that which is here called the Kingdom of Heaven, the work of Grace; and it is therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a Marriage, becauſe there is ſuch a neer union between all the Children of the Kingdom and Chriſt, as there is between the Husband and the Wife.</p>
               <p>I will, (for your better profiting by this ſo admirable point) go upon ſome Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; ſome Analogies and Reſemblances, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Marriages among men, and this work of Union and Conjunction with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And firſt you know, men uſe to go a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (as we call it) they do either by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or their ſpokeſmen make motions of Marriage, and declare their love, to the yong
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:37730:24"/>women, they are willing to make their wives. And this (you know) is firſt before there is an actual poſſeſſing and uniting: Even ſo we read 2 Cor. 5.20. <hi>Now then we are Ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us; we pray you in Chriſts ſteed, that ye be reconciled to God</hi> Now when Chriſt was in the fleſh, he went a woing himſelf in his own perſon. John 3.19. <hi>Light is come into the world; end men love darkneſs, &amp;c.</hi> But <hi>ver.</hi> 29. of that <hi>chap.</hi> he hath a ſpokeſman, he goes a woing by his friend: <hi>He that hath the Bride is the Bridegroom,</hi> (as you ſhall find there:) <hi>but the friend of the Bridegroom, which ſtandeth and heareth him, rejoyceth greatly becauſe of the Bridegrooms voice.</hi> That ſpokeſman there meant, was <hi>John Baptiſt.</hi> And the Bridegroom there meant, is Chriſt now incarnate, though the ſon of God from everlaſting; He was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward crucified, dead, and buried, and roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the third day, this is the Husband of the Church, this is the yong man that is to be married (as we uſe to ſay.) Curſed be they that deſtroy the Hiſtory, under a pretence of embracing the Myſtery, (as ſome abſurd men have in my hearing, whom I therefore queſtioned, but it was not in a time ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.) But I ſay this, Chriſt went a woing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:37730:25"/>himſelf, but now by his meſſengers he doth it in Goſpel-Preaching.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, There is a mutual conſent after the time of woing. This is called a receiving 1 John 12.

                  <hi>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the ſons of God, even to them that believe on his name.</hi> And indeed this is the very union, and eſſence of the Marriage. For ſuch are regenerated, as it followeth ver. 13. <hi>Which are born not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi> Tis a match. <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his,</hi> ſaith the Spouſe. <hi>Canticles</hi> 2.16.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, There is an enjoying each other in the Married condition. Can. 1. ver. 2.3.4. <hi>Let him kiſs me with the kiſſes of his mouth: for thy love is better then Wine. Becauſe of the ſavour of thy good Ointment, thy name is as Ointment poured forth, therefore the Virgines love thee. Draw me, we will run after thee, the King hath brought me into his chambers: We will be glad and rejoyce in thee, we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy love more then Wine; the upright love thee:</hi> O, who can imagine what this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret enjoying of Chriſt is, that hath not felt it? There is a kind of ſpiritual copulation, between Chriſt and every true believer; Yea alſo between Chriſt and Congregations,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:37730:25"/>which are ſo many Mothers to bring forth.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And this puts me upon a fourth likeneſs. Wives bleſſed of God, <hi>are like fruitfull Vines upon the Walls of the houſe, whoſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſtand like Olive plants round about the Table.</hi> Pſal. 128.3. Such as are married in the fear of God, have a promiſe of this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
               <p>This is made good; Firſt in each Saints growth in Grace, Iſaiah 61.10. <hi>I will greatly rejoyce in the Lord, my Soul ſhall be joyfull in my God: For he hath clothed me with the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Salvation, he hath covered me with the Robe of Righteouſneſs, as a Bridegroom decketh himſelf with Ornaments, and as a Bride adorneth herſelf with Jewels.</hi> The Saints are led forward towards perfection <hi>Heb</hi> 6.1.

               </p>
               <p>And then Secondly, In the Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it is alſo verified. Iſaiah 61.4, 5, 6. <hi>And they ſhall build the old waſtes, they ſhall raiſe up the former deſolations, and they ſhall

This comes to paſs by Chriſts Husband ſhip; the Church ſeemingly barren, and a Widdow, brings forth many Children to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, There is a tranſacting of conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I ſay, Firſt, We may be informed of the great worth of Goſpel Ordinances, under which there is ſuch a neerneſs held forth, yea ſuch a conjunction with Chriſt enjoyed.

For there (to wit in the uſe of Church Ordinances) the Lord commanded the bleſſing, even life for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.3. and again. <hi>By night on my bed I ſought him whom my Soul loveth.</hi> Cant. 3.1. That is in the Communion of Saints and enjoyment of Ordinances. They

It is not an ordinary one, it is no ſmall thing to be Married to the Son of God. We have great and many particular things to take comfort in, but I will be brief.</p>
               <p>Firſt. He looks for nothing to draw his Love; therefore our want of beauty cannot diſſolve the knot.</p>
               <p>Secondly, No infirmity in us, can draw away his Love from us, for his Love is immutably firm, becauſe it is Eternal and Free.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Nothing can hinder our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with him; we have a priviledge to carry about Chriſt with us.</p>

And ſo (by the way) ought the Church and every Chriſtian to be in their Reproofs, Checks, Admonitions; of the ſame frame of ſpirit, aiming at the good of the party dealt withall, as in their moſt pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dealings: <hi>Let all your things be done in Charity</hi> I ſay, (to return to this branch of the comfort) All the world cannot ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate you, nor hinder you from enjoying Chriſt, no not a minute; ſin may be an occaſion of a hiding of his face. But God would not let his people ſin if it were not for their good; <hi>For all things muſt work together for their good Rom.</hi> 8.28. This is a mighty priviledge the Saints have.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He will enable you to do what he commands you. The Saints have not only habitual Grace, to wit, the new Creature: But alſo, the Lord is bound by promiſe to be with them, to direct them, to help them, and aſſiſt them, with continual ſupplies of Grace; for they are taught to wait upon him and to ſeek unto him, &amp; to be much in trading with God, and all his Fact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, and therefore muſt needs be better able to do his will. You ſhall find Pſal. 25.12. <hi>What man is he that feareth the Lord? Him
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:37730:28"/>will he teach the way that he ſhall chooſe.</hi> The greateſt hindrance of Gods ſervice, and of doing his will, is fear. Now God being Lord of the affections, can quickly take away fear or give trembling; but he is bound by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>as to withhold no good thing;</hi> ſo to withdraw every evil thing, (as all that hinders obedience is evil) from his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the Love of God which is by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this Union, is above all Love, it ſhall tranſcend all Love. The happieſt Wife in the World may poſſibly expect or deſire too much from her Husband, though the beſt Husband in the World. We cannot be too bold with God in expecting or deſiring, unleſs it be in ſinfull deſires. I ſay, We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect too much from God; We can never build too much upon his Love; it is tranſcendent.</p>

Goſpel preaching is Ordained and appointed of the Lord to that end, that men may hear of Chriſt, believe in Chriſt, be ſaved by Chriſt, and be glorified with Chriſt.

               <p>Now theſe <hi>teachings</hi> of God are of two ſorts; the one <hi>extraordinary</hi> and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate; So <hi>Amos</hi> 7.14.15. <hi>I was neither Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, nor ſon of a Prophet, &amp;c.

               <p>There are and have ben foor ſorts of Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the World.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some taught by God and not by men.</p>

               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:37730:36"/>
               <p n="4">4. Others, (bold Bayards,) that never were taught either by God or men. And yet many there are that take upon them to teach and interpret Scripture, that are poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fitted, that cannot be ſaid <hi>to abide in the things that they have learned.</hi> 2 Tim. 3.14.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the matter is of great weight, in theſe <hi>ſpeaking times</hi> (as they Phraſe it) I will a little ſtay upon it, for ſatisfaction to ſuch as are deſirous of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore you muſt know that every one that taketh upon him to be a ſervant of the Lord in this work of preaching, muſt be taught <hi>one</hi> way or <hi>another.</hi> And therefore they are to be blamed that take upon them to be teachers of the Goſpel, and were never taught by <hi>revelation,</hi> or by any <hi>ordinary way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, They muſt teach what they have <hi>learned;</hi> they therefore are to be blamed, that deliver opinions which they never learned from the Scriptures or any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That it is moſt orderly that Goſpel-Preachers be ordained, and put apart by men, acccording to rule for Preaching.</p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:37730:37"/>
               <p>Fourthly, That yet in times and places, where there is a common corruption of Doctrine or a common abuſe of the office of teaching, and neglecting of ordaining Godly as well as learned men, there ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times men Godly, <hi>competently</hi> learned, by an <hi>inſtinct as it were</hi> for a time may teach and preach, and find the Lord with them. But all muſt take heed of nulling offices, and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and alſo of refuſing, when they may <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly</hi> have an <hi>outward</hi> call, to accept of it. For although God upon <hi>great</hi> changes doth diſpence with ſome things about his Church for a time, as he did with circumciſion in the Wilderneſs; Yet the <hi>firſt</hi> opportunities muſt be taken of returning to the exact rules of the Word for preaching and other Church-Ordinances.</p>
               <p>But I return whence I digreſſed, to ſhew you, that not all but <hi>Some</hi> ſpecial ſervants of the Lord, are made uſe of for this work of winning People to Chriſt, in the way of publike teaching. For otherwiſe, all are to <hi>improve</hi> their intereſts, and to be (as we may ſay) <hi>coadjutors</hi> to the Goſpel-Teachers.</p>

                  </label> We may hence learn, That God in the offer of Grace, is wonderfull patient. The truth is, God is wonderfully excellent in all
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:37730:45"/>his makings forth: but now we are to ſpeak of the patience of God as it is ſhewed and exerciſed to mankinde. But I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make out to you what kinde of beam of God that is which we call <hi>patience.</hi> I will not meddle with the patience of Chriſt: that (I mean) which he ſhewed in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which he took; but of that which is attributed to God, and is handled among his divine perfections.</p>
               <p>There is not <hi>ſuch</hi> a patience in God (as the word properly ſignifies) which is verſed in griefs or calamities, but in <hi>injuries</hi> and wrongs. As a King is ſaid to be patient which moderatly beareth abuſes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains himſelf from revenge which he might eaſily take if he would.
<note place="margin">Poſſe &amp; nolle no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile.</note> O this is a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vertue in man; But in God it is a moſt glorious beam, to wit, when he acteth this way, to ſuffer ſinners, and not to take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon them. This <hi>infinitely</hi> excelleth the patience of the moſt patient men in the world: becauſe the abuſes which are offered to God, are infinitely greater then thoſe which are offered to men; and becauſe he doth moſt diſtinctly ſee them all, and doth moſt ſharply <hi>reſent</hi> them, and hath in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wayes to take vengeance, and yet he withholds. He knows all that he hath done
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:37730:46"/>for us,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Simul in conſpectu Dei ſunt omnia be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficia quae ipſe in nos, &amp; omnes injuriae, &amp;c.</hi> Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius.</note> and on the other ſide our ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. He ſees all the abominations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the world; which did the moſt patient man in the world ſee but one hour, he would certainly burn the world the next (ſaith a late VVriter.) And although God be not capable of grief and ſorrow, yet he very bitterly takes his diſhonour, and is provoked to revenge. He perceives the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs of ſin; and that his own Majeſty, &amp; his unſpeakable goodneſs ſhewed to the creature is vilepended. He is armed with thouſands of Plagues, and yet <hi>forbears:</hi> yea, continues his former benefits; expecting, and ſtirring up to Repentance, and to <hi>come to his ſons Marriage.</hi> Admirable patience!

                  </label> That worldly affairs are a great occaſion unto worldly-minded people, to make them ſet light by the Goſpel and the means of grace and ſalvation.</q>
               <p>It is obſerved of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that even to this day, they are a <hi>worldly thriving</hi> people; where ever they come, within a little while they grow rich. And hence was it, that the generality of them thought it not <hi>worth their labour</hi> to look after matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Even as to this day we finde our honeſt Hogs juſt of that temper, which are our beſt neighbours. For we have ſo many barking, yea biting dogs, that theſe grunting Swine ſeem to be very honeſt men among us. But yet in truth, you muſt pardon me; O ye my honeſt courteous neighbours, I muſt <hi>render evil for your good</hi> (as perhaps you will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it, untill your eyes be opened.) You
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:37730:56"/>undervalue opportunities of Worſhip, you attend not the places of worſhip. Whats the Reaſon? Surely becauſe ye think that while ye are attending the affairs of the world ye are imployed in your <hi>lawfull</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and therefore that your abſence from the Means of grace may very well be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And becauſe this is ſuch a plauſible evil, ſuch a <hi>poiſon of Aſps,</hi> I will ſpeak a little of it by way of digreſſion.</p>
               <p>Know therefore, that there is not a man alive that hath not a touch, a tang (as we ſay) of this evil. Yet nevertheleſs it is as dangerous an evil, and as incompatible with Grace, when it becomes predominant, as any ſin whatſoever. And it is to be noted, that of <hi>all</hi> Sins ſeldom are the Saints of God tainted with this in Scripture; And alſo that ſuch as fall into it, ſeldom return to their wonted glory and luſtre in the Church. VVhereas we find <hi>Peter</hi> denying his Maſter, and <hi>David</hi> falling into Adultery, and <hi>Lot</hi> into drunkenneſs &amp;c. yet we finde a return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again, a recovery out of their falls. But when men give themſelves to covetouſneſs, we may fitly compare this ſin to that <hi>deep ditch</hi> which <hi>Solomon</hi> compares a whore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: <hi>They that come into it, return not again, neither take they hold of the paths of life:</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:37730:56"/>You have an example in <hi>Demas</hi> how he broke his neck quite, in falling into this ditch of the World. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. We never read of his recovery. Let me a little declame, or if it muſt be ſo, exclame) againſt theſe hoggs and Swine. Do you think the land you have is yours? or the Silver and Gold you have is yours?

O when a wretched man (a beaſt rather) ſhall have an eſtate thrown into his hands; and ſhall either hugg it as a God, or wallow in it, as the Swine do in dirty muddy places, and ſhall never regard to uſe any part of it to Gods Glory nor to the good of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, nor to the comfort of the poor; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ay ſome will ſcarce allow what is <hi>needfull</hi> for their own nouriſhment: like <hi>Tantalus</hi> up to the chin in water, and yet dying for thirſt, &amp;c. I ſay, when ſuch a running out of the Soul is in a man after the World, is it likely there will be any great mind upon the things of God, of Chriſt, of Salvation? Truly no. This ſin is like the diſeaſe called the <hi>hectick feaver,</hi> at firſt hard to be diſcerned, but eaſie to be cured; but at laſt eaſie to be known
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:37730:57"/>(ſure enough) when it is grown incurable.</p>
               <p>When worldlineſs breaketh out into groſs oppoſition of the wayes of God, (take heed (honeſt and kind neighbours) you will come to it at laſt, if you do not take heed) I ſay, when it is come to a hight, then the Soul is (as it were) <hi>becruſted,</hi> ſeared; it will not be diſcerned eaſily by ſuch a Soul, that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs hath any harm in it at all; Tis good husbandry, thriftineſs. Men grow bold to <hi>plead</hi> for it, and for their neglect of duty, to do other things. See how bold <hi>Martha</hi> is. <hi>Mary</hi> was hearkning to Chriſt preaching; <hi>Martha</hi> was cooking it, and dreſſing meat for Chriſts dinner; Out cries <hi>Martha</hi> to Chriſt (you ſhall find it Luk. 10.40.) <hi>Lord, doſt not thou not care that my ſiſter hath left me to ſerve alone? bid her therefore that ſhe help me.</hi> And if it be ſo in the green tree, how much more in the dry? If good People under a temptation, be ſo bold to plead for their neglect of attending upon Chriſt, and to blame them thar are more carefull, and ſtrict then themſelves; how much more will ſuch as are <hi>ſwallowed</hi> up (as it were) of the World be bold? But you ſee in that place of <hi>Luke,</hi> what Chriſt the King of the Church doth. He falls a <hi>chiding</hi> of <hi>Martha,</hi> not of <hi>Mary.</hi> He tells her <hi>Mary
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:37730:57"/>had choſen the good part.</hi> Worldly people ſay to the Almighty, <hi>depart from us;</hi> they hold it good wiſdom, to labour and ſave while they be yong, that they may not live in want when they be old. It cannot be denied but this is good Wiſdom in its place. But they are penny wiſe, and pound fooliſh, as it is ſaid of the Widdows that <hi>live in pleaſure,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.6. they are <hi>dead while they live. For what is a man profited if he winn the whole World, and loſe his own Soul? or what ſhall a man give in exchange for his Soul? Mat.</hi> 16.26. I tell you for every hours coming to Sermons, ſpent in praier, thouſhalt be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; thou ſhalt have the comfort of it one day. Time ſpent in Gods ſervice is the beſt ſpent time. When once you come to know the <hi>terrors of the Lord,</hi> you will not think any labour too great, to get news of a crucified Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Galeaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</note> nor all the wealth in the world to be compared to one Minutes Society with Jeſus Chriſt. O my mouth is opened, my heart is enlarged. O what would a damned Soul in Hell give to come out of his condition? I am the more earneſt, upon mine indignation at the abominable boldneſs of earthly-minded People. Tis well twas Chriſt himſelf ſpake, and that it was to <hi>Martha.</hi> If we ſhould ſay but half ſo much to Chriſts pretended
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:37730:58"/>Diſciples now, we ſhould hear of it again hot and wholy (as our country folks phraſe it.) and they would tell us that if all ſhould be of our minde, we ſhould all quickly go a begging; and <hi>our hair would grow through our hood.</hi> We ſhould have as good as we bring; Such is the boldneſs of covetous perſons; Such is the conceit that People have of the harmleſneſs, yea or rather of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendableneſs of worldlineſs; whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is a vice full of <hi>deadly poyſon,</hi> full of ignorance of God, of Atheiſme, of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Injuſtjce, Oppreſſion, and indeed of all iniquity: as will be more at large ſhewed in the uſes of the Point, which now I come unto. <label type="milestone">

It is (ſaith the Doctine) a great occaſion to make People ſet light by the means of Grace, holy &amp; religious employments; and therefore it muſt needs be a very dangerous thing, for a man or woman to let his or her affections to run out after the world. 1 Tim. 6.9.10. <hi>But they that will be rich, fall into temptation, and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full luſts, which drown men in deſtruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil, which while ſome coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and peirced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:37730:58"/>thorrow with many ſorows.</hi> It is the ready way to reſtrain and keep back our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from God, and good excerciſes; and a ſign that men do not <hi>ſavor</hi> of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to let them runn out after the things of the World. Now the things of the World are (as <hi>John</hi> ſaith 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.16.) <hi>the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life:</hi> that is, Voluptuouſneſs, Covetouſneſs, Ambition. Let me ſingle out this <hi>Goliah</hi> to encounter it, and draw out the <hi>ſword of the ſpirit,</hi> out of that ſheath <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.4. <hi>Riches profit not in the day of wrath.</hi> And <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 7.19. <hi>They ſhall caſt their ſilver in the ſtreets, and their gold ſhall be removed: their Silver and their gold ſhall not be able to deliver them in the day of the Lords wrath: they ſhall not ſatisfie their Souls, neither fill their bowels, becauſe it is the ſtumbling block of their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> And ſo we might ſay of all the pomp of this World. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49 6.17. <hi>When men die they ſhall carry nothing away: their glory ſhall not deſcend after them.</hi> And the forenamed <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 7. <hi>ver.</hi> 10.11. <hi>Behold the day, behold it is come, the morning is gone forth, the rod hath bloſſomed, Pride hath budded, Violence is riſen up into a rod of wickedneſs: none of them ſhall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs, neither ſhall there be wailing for them.</hi> You have ſeen the danger both of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:37730:59"/>Soul and body too. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>2</label> Come we to a ſecond information, of the ſinfullneſs of their ſin, &amp; the greatneſs of their abomination, that let their ſpirits run out after the world. They go quite contrary to God, that neglect his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths and Sanctuary. <hi>Exod.</hi> 31 15. <hi>Six dayes may work be done, but in the ſeventh is the Sabbath of reſt, holy to the Lord: whoſoever doth any work in the Sabbath day, he ſhall ſurely be put to death.</hi> And ſo <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.27. But God threatens to kindle a fire, not to be quenched, to devour the places of ſuch as will not hearken to <hi>hallow</hi> the Sabbath day. If men will not <hi>hallow</hi> Gods Sabbaths, nor reverence his Sanctuaries, but will be <hi>croſs</hi> to God, God will be croſs to them. They that cannot allow him his own day, becauſe they are ſo drownd in the world, that they cannot <hi>remember</hi> it before it comes, much leſs <hi>obſerv</hi> it when it is come: God will lay great ſin to their charge becauſe it proceeds from under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing of him, through ignorance, &amp; this hath much ſinfullneſs in it. Therefore <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33. Chriſt wils to <hi>ſeek firſt the kingdom of God;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a very ſinfull thing to prefer the world before God, &amp; the things of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. God and the very quinteſſence of the world ſtand in oppoſition <hi>ex diametro.</hi> The very <hi>wiſdom of the fleſh is enmity to God. Rom.</hi> 8.7. And thence is it that there is ſo much ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:37730:59"/>in the love of the World, becauſe the ſpirit and the ſoul do runn out <hi>exceſſively</hi> after the World, and do take great delight in theſe carnal things. And when the Soul and affection runs out to take pleaſure and delight in any thing more then in God, there is there much ſinfullneſs.</p>
               <p>There is in ſin three thing conſiderable. The <hi>baſeneſs</hi> of it, the <hi>viciouſneſs</hi> of it, and the <hi>ſinfullneſs</hi> of it. Now tis true, there is not ſo much baſeneſs in this ſin, as there is in ſome others; As to inſtance in Adultery, it is a ſin that hath much baſeneſs in it, it carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with it <hi>a ſtain, and a blot that ſhal never be blotted out.</hi> Yet this ſin of worldlineſs, is a far greater ſin; though it be not <hi>majoris infamiae,</hi> of greater infamie; yet it is <hi>Majoris culpae</hi> of greater fault; there is far more irregularity in it. <label type="milestone">

                  </label> I <hi>anſwer,</hi> Men do not uſe to judge of ſin according to the rules of the Word, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtomes of men. And among men, it is meet, that ſometimes ſins, though of leſſer fault in themſelves, yet of more <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous conſequence,</hi> and more deſtructive to the peace and comfort of humane ſociety, ſhould be more ſeverely puniſhed, and ſo conſequently the committers of it, more hooted at, and had in diſhonour. And this
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:37730:60"/>is the cauſe that Covetouſneſs paſſeth ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and quietly, through the judgements of men, untill it come to <hi>break out</hi> into Robberies and violencies which are preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to the peace of men living together in humane Society.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, There is in ſome ſins more <hi>vitiouſneſs,</hi> then in otherſome: Sins that are againſt <hi>Moral Vertues,</hi> and <hi>Natural Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> do ſtare more Gaſtly ſometies, then greater ſins againſt God do: Becauſe a man that hath no Grace, hath yet a <hi>Conſcience,</hi> which is a true rule according to its propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but is too ſhort to meaſure ſins by that are more <hi>immediately</hi> committed againſt God. So <hi>Paul</hi> when he was <hi>Saul, lived in all good Conſcience,</hi> Acts 23.1. He ſaw not the greatneſs of the ſin of <hi>perſecuting the Saints.</hi> He thought he had done very well in deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo cruelly as he did with the Church; there was not vitiouſneſs in it, according to the Rules of <hi>Morality,</hi> nor the outward Rules men uſe to go by in meaſuring ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Now by this time ye ſee, what I drive at; to wit, to ſhew you that though there be neither ſo much baſeneſs or vitiouſneſs in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the world, as in Adultery and ſome other ſins: yet that it is a very high ſin, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:37730:60"/>ſtrikes deep into Gods <hi>honour:</hi> And it is the more dangerous, by how much the leſs mens help againſt this evil is. If our Sermons will not deterr you from the every, or robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or murther, or adultery; yet the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows may. There are <hi>ſevere Laws</hi> againſt theſe ſins, and they are ſins in the eſteem of the world, and ſins againſt <hi>natural conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> and all is a help againſt theſe ſins. But againſt thoſe Maladies, to make light of Chriſt, of Goſpel. Seaſons, of bleſſed Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; not to delight in God; to be glad when we have wealth, to put our truſt in <hi>Princes;</hi> to be very penſive at the frowns and threats of men; not to put our truſt in the <hi>living</hi> God, and the like; here wants mens <hi>laws,</hi> the worlds vote, and natural conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to accuſe. And yet theſe and ſuch like ſins are far greater, and have far more ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in them, then thoſe other forementioned ſins of <hi>infamy:</hi> A man may go for an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Profeſſour of Religion, and yet be worldly. To refuſe Chriſt,
<note place="margin">M. <hi>Capel.</hi>
                  </note> or but to <hi>neglect</hi> the offer of grace, is more ſinfull then forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, yea then adultery. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.28, 29. will teach us, that ſuch ſinners are worthy of <hi>ſorer puniſhment</hi> incomparably then ſuch as break, nay deſpiſe all <hi>Moſes Law.</hi> If you have but your minde upon work, or upon

               <p>And ſo I come to the Uſe of Counſell, and ſo ſhall end this Point of Doctrine.</p>
               <p>I adviſe every good man to take care, that his worldly affairs be no hinderance to him in receiving Chriſt, or occaſions of <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteeming</hi> Gods grace in the means thereof offered to him, after the faſhion of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men that know not what it is in the way of mercy to enjoy an Ordinance and <hi>Chriſt</hi> in it, or to neglect it in a way of ſin.</p>

               <p>Secondly, His conviction thereupon, both which are in the 12. <hi>ver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, His condemnation, or the Lords Commiſſion and warrant for his execution, with the ground or reaſon thereof. <hi>ver.</hi> 13.14. of which afterward.</p>
               <p>In his Examination we have,
<list>
                     <item>1. The matter laid to his charge.</item>
                     <item>2. The manner of Gods dealing.</item>
                  </list> 
                  <hi>How cameſt thou hither not having a Wedding garment,</hi> is his charge. This man came with others to the marriage of the Kings ſon, but he came unprovided, he was without a Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding garment; and this is the ſumm of his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and the fault that is laid to his charge; aggravated by his impudency, in daring to come in that trim. <hi>How cameſt thou in hither,</hi> &amp;c. that is, how didſt thou dare be ſo bold, to come hither unprepared?</p>
               <p>The great queſtion is, what is meant here by the Wedding garment. The Papiſts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand hereby love and good works, but they miſs the mark. By the Wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we are here to underſtand, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of our Lord Jeſus put on by the hand of a true ſaving and juſtifying faith, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by a holy, ſincere, and upright walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the wayes of godlineſs: and therefore
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:37730:92"/>the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking to this purpoſe, and ſomewhat altering this phraſe; wills us <hi>to put off the works of darkneſs, and to put on the armour of light,</hi> Rom. 13.12. And in the next two verſes he expounds his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz. Not in chambering and wantonneſs, not in ſtrife and envying; but putting on Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> where Chriſt and a mans own luſts, his ſinfull luſts are oppoſed, read <hi>ver.</hi> 13. and 14. and he doth more fully mention this <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.21, 22, 23. In theſe words and phraſes, <hi>To hear him, to be taught by him, as the truth is in Jeſus. To put off the old man, to be renewed in the ſpirit of our minds, to put on the new man;</hi> All which is performed by the power of ſound and ſaving faith. <hi>For ye are all the children of God by faith in Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 3.26. And again, <hi>For as many of you as have been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt,</hi> ver. 27.</p>
               <p>By all which you may ſee plainly what it is to have, or to want the Wedding garment. The ſum of the Charge brought againſt this Profeſſor in my Text, was, that he wanted ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, he was not that he profeſſed himſelf to be. He drew no vertue from Chriſt, he had not put on Chriſt by Faith, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not walk in ſound and ſincere obedience.</p>

               <p>Secondly the neceſſity; for elſe, <hi>Friend how cameſt thou in hither?</hi> will be heard one day.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the difficulty of having this Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhould move us to be ſolicitous, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious about it. Naturally we are all liars, apt to deceive our ſelves. We muſt know, <hi>that all have not faith.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.2.

                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4.16. to 22.</note> Luk. 18.8. And yet none can put on the Lord Jeſus without it. Such as walk after the courſe of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which know not God, have not put on <hi>Chriſt;</hi> they have but an outſide at moſt of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:37730:94"/>Chriſtianity, and not the Wedding Garment here ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>We are next to ſpeak of the manner of his Examination, implyed in the word,

               <p>
                  <hi>But why doth the Lord call this unworthy gueſt Friend? he knew him to be his Foe and Adverſary, and a diſſembling Friend.</hi>
               </p>

So his ſeeming holy profeſſion did the more aggravate his wickedneſs. And alſo it may be, that the Lord thus proceeds, to take away all exception, and to ſtop up every ſtarting hole. Men now pick quarrels at the manner of Miniſters reproving them, it is a common ſhift among us in this place (ſo wiſe are men to their own hurt) to put off juſt reproofs with accuſations of paſſion, and bitterneſs in the Speakers of the Word; as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was called the raving Propher, and accuſed to have his ears more open then was fit, to that tale-telling fellow <hi>Baruch</hi> the ſon of <hi>Neriah:</hi> So men inſtead of ſorrowing, and making ſatisfaction for thoſe evils of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, deceit, rejecting of Chriſt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing

               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:37730:105"/>
               <p>The Servants which God makes uſe of here on earth to binde hand and foot, &amp;c. are Firſt, Miniſters; theſe are Gods high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to binde and to looſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.18 <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you, whatſoever ye ſhall binde on earth ſhall be bound in heaven, &amp;c.</hi> It is true, it is properly the work of the Church. But the Miniſters are appointed of God for the doing of the work. I will give you the words of Dr. <hi>Fulk</hi> in his Annotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> Teſtament, upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. in anſwer to that paſſage pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be taken out of <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> upon thoſe words, <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> Matth. 18. <hi>Complain to the Church, that is, to the Prelates and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents thereof:</hi> ſaith he, <hi>The authority of Excommunication pertaineth to the whole Church, although the judgment and execution thereof is to be referred to the Governors of the Church, which exerciſe that authority as in the name of Chriſt, ſo in the name of the whole Church to avoid confuſion.</hi> So he. <hi>It is a ſad buſineſs to be bound by thoſe Servants of the King of Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Magiſtrates are executioners too of Gods vengeance; <hi>They bear not the ſword in vain.</hi> Rom. 13.4. <hi>For he is the Miniſter of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil,</hi> in the ſame verſe. VVhen
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:37730:105"/>people will not take warning by Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters words, nor by his judgements on others: God ſuffers them to fall into the hands of Magiſtrates, who have places of pain and ſhame, Gaoles, <hi>Bridewells,</hi> ſtocks, whipping-Poſts and Gallowſes. Theſe bind neck and heels alſo in Gods name, and as his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Military men, which have the ſword of war in their hands, are Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. <hi>Aſhur is the rod of Gods anger, and the ſtaff in his hand is Gods indignation.</hi> God ſends ſuch, and gives them a charge <hi>to take the ſpoil, and to take the prey, and to tread down the people of his wrath as the mire of the ſtreets,</hi> Iſa. 10.5, 6.</p>
               <p>Theſe are moſt terrible of all; for firſt, they do not uſually proceed ſo regularly as either of the former. Miniſters have a word to proceed by, and Magiſtrates have Laws; but weapons know not laws;
<note place="margin">Arma ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciunt le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> 
                  <hi>Will</hi> is the rule, if not rage, or deſperate fury uſually. <hi>Aſhur hath not God in his thoughts, when he goeth to deſtroy and cut off nations not a few,</hi> Iſa. 10.7.</p>
               <p>Secondly, their Bindings have much cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, their Language is more terrible, they are people of a fierce language; Cut their skuls, cleave their heads, even when I ſhould

I intend not to diſhonour the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; we have found much of God in many of them of latter times. But yet they are the moſt dreadfull Servants of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, God hath binding Angels both good and bad. <hi>Herod</hi> is ſmitten by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Lord, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.23. And 185 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand are killed in one night by an Angel of the Lord, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.35.

               <p>The Reaſon is, becauſe they are bound as it were hand and foot. God hath ordained Bands and Chains to bind wicked men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; They are bound with a threefold Cord which is not quickly broken; Beſides the Chains and cords, which God binds wicked men withal, to Hell torments, there is a threefold Cord to bind them with in this life.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Cord of Gods Decree. <hi>Jude's</hi> Epiſtle, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>Who were before of old or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to this condemnation.</hi> All the men on
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:37730:113"/>Earth, or Angels in Heaven, are not able to break this Cord. There is alſo a bleſſed Cord which the Saints are bound with, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Moreover, whom he did predeſtinate, them alſo he called: and whom he called, them alſo he juſtified; and whom he juſtified, them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he glorified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The uſe that we may make of it is to bleſs God if we ſind we are not bound with that chain that the wicked are bound with: but with that fore-appointed for the Saints.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Cord to bind men, is that, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.18. <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall bind on Earth, ſhall be bound in Heaven.</hi> This Church bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is the ſecond, with which men are bound. And for my part, I would not lie under the juſt cenſure of a well-ordered Church, for the whole World.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is, becauſe the Scriptures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true, whom the Church binds on Earth, God binds in Heaven.</p>
               <p>There are three acts in this binding; God acts firſt and laſt, and the Church in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. God acts firſt in giving rules to his Church to walk by. The Church acts by thoſe rules which God hath given; and are like <hi>Levi</hi> which knew not father nor mother. And this acting of a Church, carrieth more in it then the reproof of one Godly man,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:37730:113"/>though a publick Preacher) becauſe of the Authority which the Lord hath given to his Church. And then thirdly, God acts in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming in Heaven what the Church regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly doth on Earth.</p>
               <p>There is in the Church, uſe of ordinary and common brotherly admonitions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations; with this Cord the People of God bind one another to the Lord. So, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Take heed brethren, leſt there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God. But exhort one another daily, while it called to day, leſt any of you be hardned through the deceitfullneſs of ſin.</hi> And therefore all the People of the Lord ſhould look upon this work as a duty: and when it is performed, it ſhould be looked upon as a mercy from the Lord to tie us cloſer to him. Beſides this, ſometimes the unruly are to be warned, and deſired to forbear from communicating with the People of God. This is as it were the trial of Leproſie: We uſually call it ſuſpenſion from the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: and it hath its uſe as a cord to bind men to the good behaviour, or to diſcover their Spirits.</p>
               <p>But in the laſt place,
<note place="margin">Fulk on 1 Cor. 5. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>Rhem. Teſt.</hi>

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:37730:114"/>name of the Church and People, to avoid confuſion.

And if it do not, then he is thereby bound over to everlaſting burnings. Tis true in ſome ſence they are ſaid to be cut off from the Church; namely in a threefold reſpect.</p>

               <p>Secondly, From God; for what the Church rightly doth on Earth, God doth in Heaven; If the Church bind on Earth, God binds in Heaven, (and ſo for Looſing alſo.)</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In regard of themſelves for a time; they are cut off, becauſe they want the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:37730:114"/>power and efficacy of the ſpirit, untill they be throughly touched with repentance, and begin as it were to live again. Take heed ye that are bound with this Cord of God and his Church, and labour to be unbound again.</p>
               <p>There is a third Cord, wherewith men are bound even in this life; and that is the Cord of Conſcience; As this unworthy Gueſt here was bound, he had not a word to ſay for himſelf. He was bound hand and foot; he was haltered (as it were) that he could not ſtirr. So <hi>Judas</hi> was ſo haltered with the Cord of his Conſcience, that he could not chuſe but halter his neck too; <hi>For he went away and hanged himſelf,</hi> Mat. 27.5. This is a ſad Cord when God is pleaſed to make uſe of it. O when a mans Conſcience ſhall tell him, <hi>that he hath no part nor portion in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, that his heart is not right in the ſight of God,</hi> (as <hi>Peter</hi> told <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> Acts 8.21.) <hi>that he is in the Gall of bitterneſs and bond of iniquity:</hi> This will be black News to that poor wretch whoſoever he be.</p>

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:37730:117"/>in the fruit of his body, and of his land, the increaſe of his kine, and the flocks of his ſheep. Curſed when he cometh in, and curſed when he goeth out. Curſing vexation, and rebuke ſhall follow him in all that he ſetteth his hand unto.</hi> Deut 20.16. to the 21. <hi>ver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, A graceleſs man (to uſe a Country phraſe) is an unlucky fellow. It is a bleſſing properly to a godly man, that whatſoever he doth, it ſhall proſper, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.3. Again, a graceleſs man makes the naked creature (without an eye to the Creator) the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his happineſs; like a fooliſh man that hath great ſtore of birds in his field, and becauſe they have pitch'd in his field, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts them all his, not conſidering that they will riſe and flie away, when he comes neer to them to take them.</p>
               <p>So will all that wicked men have, wherein they put their confidence; when God comes to have to do with them, it will appear that they, with all that they have are good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to be caſt away.</p>

               <p>Firſt, the manner of his puniſhment.</p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:37730:121"/>
               <p>And Secondly, The condition of the man puniſhed.</p>
               <p>The former hath been diſpatched in the forenoon. And many ſhort notes have been given you of it.</p>
               <p>As 1. That ungodly men ſhall not eſcape puniſhment, from the words, <hi>Bind him hand and foot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is a puniſhment to be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from God, and from the comfortable ſociety of his People; From theſe words, <hi>and take him away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That all wicked men are a company of Caſt-aways; From theſe words, <hi>Caſt him out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, That unſpeakably, unconceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſad and wofull will the condition of ungodly men be after death; From theſe words, <hi>outer darkneſs. Caſt him into outer darkneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it remaineth, that ſomething be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the condition the Party puniſhed ſhould be in under this puniſhment; or a deſcription of the place into which he was caſt,
<note place="margin">Poena dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, poena ſenſus.</note> which is here intimated to be a place <hi>of weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> The former words of the verſe, do but ſet forth the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of loſs, but this the puniſhment of ſenſe. <hi>Weeping</hi> doth uſually attend upon pain,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:37730:122"/>ſorrow, calamity; but <hi>gnaſhing of teeth,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports great tribulation, and anguiſh. That ſorrow which is ſet out by <hi>gnaſhing of teeth,</hi> is a great ſorrow. It ſhews great torment, agonies, and pains to be the portion of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men. This little portion remained intended for the forenoon; but time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the delivery of it then. Therefore take it now in theſe words,</p>

               <p>This point is evident from the effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> And we have other places beſides the Text to make good the Point; which I will read unto you.</p>
               <p>As firſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.50. <hi>And ſhall caſt them into a furnace of fire; there ſhall be wailing and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> Cap. 25.30. <hi>And caſt ye the unprofitable ſervant into outer darkneſs; there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> Luke 16.23. <hi>And in Hell he lift up his eyes being in torment.</hi>

                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:37730:122"/>Rom. 2 4. to the 7. ver. <hi>God will render to every man according to his deeds.</hi> The weight of this reaſon lies upon the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God: who can as well ceaſe to be, as forbear to torment unto eternitie all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men.</p>
               <p>The torments of the Damned muſt needs be great in Hell, becauſe there they ſhall have the full vials of Gods wrath poured out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.33. <hi>For Tophet is ordained of old, yea for the King it is praepared, he hath made it deep add large: the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of the Lord like a ſtream of brimſtone doth kindle it.</hi> The Lord here doth but fight with little parties, but then he wil bring up all his Forces.

<note place="margin">D <hi>Preſton,</hi> All things come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to all.</note> And likewiſe there in the ſame verſe, you have this phraſe of <hi>treaſuring up of wrath,</hi> by hardneſs and impenitency of heart. All thoſe expreſſions are very ſignificant. Gods Juſtice here is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered;
<note place="margin">Pſa. 97.2.</note> clouds and darkneſs are round about him, though <hi>righteouſneſs and judgement be the habitation of his throne:</hi> but then there will be a diſcovery, a revelation of Gods juſtice. A man would think this were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, and ſufficient to diſcover God: the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:37730:123"/>drowning of the old World, the burning of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the other Cities of the Plain, the killing of ſo many thouſands at ſeveral times of his people in the wilderneſs (inſomuch that of ſix hundred thouſand only <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi> were left alive to go over <hi>Jordan</hi>) the drowning of that glorious Army of <hi>ſix hundred choſen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.</hi> Exod. 14.7. What do I talk? time would fail me to relate the terribleneſs of God in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing ſinners, the examples are ſo many in Scripture, &amp; have been in all Ages; and yet all this is nothing in compariſon of that day of the revelation of the righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. Here God maketh uſe of ſome particular judgements; but there <hi>the full vials of his wrath ſhall be poured out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, that torment muſt needs be great where there is no eaſe, no intermiſſion, and of which there ſhall be no end. Not ſo much as one drop of water to cool the burning tongue of the rich man in hell, &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.24, 25. he is tormented, and there is a gulf ſixed; <hi>out of hell there is no redemption,</hi> Matth. 25.46. And theſe ſhall go their way into everlaſting puniſhment, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.43, 44. <hi>The fire ſhal never be quenched, the worm dieth not.</hi> Here men are partakers of many of Gods
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:37730:123"/>gracious Vouchſafements, even ſuch as are his enemies. <hi>God cauſeth his ſun to riſe on the evil and on the good,
<note place="margin">Matth. 5.45.

Here God doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways chide, neither keepeth he his anger for ever. But then God will always chide, and will keep his anger unto all eternitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, it muſt needs be, that the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ungodly men muſt be inconceivably great; becauſe there muſt be a perfection or rather a finiſhing and conſummating of all things. All irregularities are ordered by the God of wiſdom and juſtice, to ſuch ends as ſhall be in the utmoſt end for his greater glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Every thing keeps crying and moving, and ſeeking to be perfected. As trees and plants though they move not out of their places, as men and beaſts do, yet they ſpred their Roots to get nouriſhment. And grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men run to and fro that their knowledge may be increaſed: and they are always <hi>thirſting for God, even for the living God,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is their life, and their perfection:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 42. ver. 2. Pſal. 16. v. 11.</note> and untill they come to his right hand, <hi>where there is fulneſs of joy, &amp;c.</hi> they will not be quiet. And ſo the ambitious man hath never
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:37730:124"/>honour enough, nor the covetous man wealth enough: So neither ſin puniſhment enough untill theſe times of wrath, and revelation of Gods juſtice, and the perfection of ſin (I know it is a harſh expreſsion) but this is true of all things, that they ſtrive to, and cry after their compleating.

               <p>Here we have to deal with two ſorts of People.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The prophane multitude; theſe ſay they have had a ſtrong faith from their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
               <p>But let us talk with them a little. What Demonſtration can ye make of your faith? Have ye a Mean or medium. We will help you to one out of the 2 <hi>chap.</hi> of <hi>James,</hi> and that is Works, this will be a demonſtration of the Cauſe by the Effects; <hi>If thou have faith, ſhew it,</hi> make it out, <hi>by thy works,</hi> by thy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and converſation. Love to the Saints will be another notable Mean or medium to make out a mans faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is that they (to wit, the Cauſe and the Effect) are joyned together often, as Col. 1.4. <hi>Since we heard of your faith in Chriſt,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:37730:126"/>and of the love which ye have to all the Saints.</hi> If good People be your delight, and good men the men of your counſell; if you can ſay with <hi>David,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 26.</note> that ye have not ſate with vain perſons, &amp;c.</hi> If ye account religious perſons (as Chriſt did) <hi>as your Brethren, and Siſters, and Mothers;</hi> Why then hereby ye may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate your paſſage from death to life, <hi>and that ye are born of God and know God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John 3. ver. 14. chap. 4. ver. 7.</note> And ſo theſe two Means or mediums will help ye well if ye wil be true to yourſelves. If ye have a reſpect to all the Commandments; there's one. And if ye have love to all the Saints, that's the other. And therefore Soul, deceive not thy ſelf any longer. If thou have neither an obedient frame of Spirit to do Gods will, nor love to the People of God, thou haſt no faith. <hi>Shew me thy faith.</hi> But you will ſay, God knows my heart; what care I for you? I will not give an account to you. Yea but I ſay, thou are bound to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to me, and to every man <hi>that asketh a reaſon of the hope that is in thee,</hi> and that with meekneſs and reverence or fear. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. But poor neighbours, it is plain, you have no faith in Chriſt; for ye are rebellions againſt the Lord, and deſpiſers of his People. The Lord pitty ye, and ſoften your hearts, <hi>that ye may eſcape the wrath to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:37730:127"/>
               <p>The other ſort I have to deal with all, are ſuch poor Souls, as out of holy and bleſſed jealouſie, are ready to condemn themſelves, and to give ſentence againſt themſelves, and indeed againſt the truth. They know not whither ever they believed, they are afraid they have not. Never went a ſoul to hell that feared the want of faith, and breathed after it. Mat. 5.3. and 6. <hi>The poor in ſpirit, and the hungerers and thirſters, &amp;c. are pronounced bleſſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But you have ſaid, Faith muſt have its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I <hi>anſwer,</hi> So they muſt, and ſo they have in thee, even in this thy emptineſs, and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, and groaning frame of ſpirit; O theſe groaning Souls are bleſſed Souls. Such a one was <hi>Paul. Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>ver.</hi> 14. to the end of the <hi>Chapter.</hi> Have a care; yeild not up your Caſtle, however it be with you, in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent apprehenſion. Learn of Chriſt, who though he cried, <hi>(why haſt thou forſaken me?)</hi> Yet held faſt his relation <hi>(my God my God,)</hi> Never diſown God; thats that the Divel would have.</p>
               <p>There are but three things, all that may ſeem to be juſt cauſes ſo to do, as, 1. Deſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 2. Great afflictions. 3. Great ſins. Yet bear up againſt them all; neither of them
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:37730:127"/>is a Medium ſufficient to conclude thy dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Neither of them are certain tokens of Gods being thine Enemy. <hi>David</hi> is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous example for all three. <hi>God did hide his face from him. And his afflictions were very many.</hi> And what ſins in a Saint, comparable to his? And <hi>Peter</hi> denied, and did aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate it with Curſing and Swearing, that he knew not Chriſt. To deſpair after a fall, is a greater fall then the fall. The main puſh, is, that perhaps thou haſt ſinned after knowledge. So did thoſe two Worthies,

We muſt fortifie our ſelves after Relapſes eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; yet a man may fall into the ſame groſs ſin after true repentance, as <hi>Abraham</hi> twice laid his wife open to adultery. But ſtill hold faſt by God, thou muſt be bold.</p>

God finds nothing in us, but miſerable nakedneſs and filthineſs: Neither are we any otherwayes reformed unto the image of God, but as we put on Chriſt. Therefore (I ſay) here is not a diſcovery or Doctrine of mans power to cloath himſelf; but of Gods Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in the work of converſion; who work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that in the elect, which he commandeth

So that (I ſay) if God that bids you come to Chriſts wedding, do not give you a wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is a ſign you are not one of his elect or choſen ones; For all are not that are called; <hi>For many are called, but few are choſen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the ſence of the words; We are by called ones here to underſtand, not ſuch as are effectually called, (as in ſundry places the word is taken; among others, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. where the Goſpel is ſaid to be the power of God unto called ones;) but here by being called, is meant only a partaking of an outward call; to wit, to hear of ſuch a one as Chriſt was, and to joyn outwardly with Chriſtians; either according to Law (I mean mans Law,) or according to cuſtom, or the practice of our forefathers; (of which called ones, the greateſt part, are but a rude heap of baptized Pagans and Infidels) or elſe, ſuch as are Temporaries and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criets, that have ſome common works of the

True it is, that ſuch as are inwardly and effectually called, are likewiſe ſo called, and ought to joyn themſelves with Gods People, and Will: But yet this is the ſumme, that many are ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led outwardly, that yet ſhall periſh ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly.

And this election from everlaſting, is called Gods purpoſe and grace (and ſaid to be) <hi>given us in Chriſt Jeſus before the world began,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.9.

               <p>Firſt, The notorious evil liver; the raſcals, of which we have (I cannot ſay good, but) great ſtore in every ſtreet in the Town.

               <p>Thirdly, but if they come to be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the outward preſcriptions for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious performances, and to pen a Sermon, or to be (as now we phraſe it) a Member of a Church: why then they are made for ever. And yet ſuch may be as far from happineſs as the worſt of men.</p>
               <p>There are laſtly, A great heap of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown Apoſtates, back-ſliders from grace, that ſhew they were never <hi>choſen of God and pretious,</hi> by their <hi>turning with the dog to their vomit, and with the Sow that waſhed to her wallowing in the mire.</hi> O the fearfull doings of our glorious times, in theſe unglorious carriages.
